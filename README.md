## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - REST Countries API

### What I learned

I learned how to work better with React Router, multiple fetches from API and theme change. It was enjoyable experience!

### Continued development

I think I'm going to continue learning React and It's ecosystem and do more difficult projects with it.
