## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing library for React
- [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) - React components library
- [Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) - REST Countries API

### What I learned

I learned how to work better with React Router, multiple fetches from API and theme change. It was enjoyable experience!

### Continued development

I think I'm going to continue learning React and It's ecosystem and do more difficult projects with it.
